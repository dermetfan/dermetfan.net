I am studying Bachelor of Computer Science (now called Bachelor of Informatics) at [H-BRS].

Currently I focus on [Rust] and the [NixOS] ecosystem.

Prior work worth mentioning:

- [libGDX] tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/dermetfan)
- [`libgdx-utils`](https://bitbucket.org/dermetfan/libgdx-utils) and `libgdx-utils-box2d`, a support library for [libGDX]-powered games and applications
